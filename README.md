Ventilator Splitter Display
===========================

![testing badge](https://github.com/tetrabiodistributed/project-tetra-display/workflows/tests/badge.svg)

A system to take pressure and flow data from sensors on a ventilator splitter, calculate descriptive parameters based on these data like PEEP or Tidal Volume, and display them for medical professionals to monitor.  This is for use against COVID-19.

To set up the display program for tests, first make sure you have `chromedriver` installed (macOS: `brew install chromedriver`, linux: `sudo apt install chromedriver`).  `chromedriver` makes it possible to validate the display output.  Then run `./setup.sh` to build the virtual environment and then `. venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment.

To do the tests, run `./runtests.sh`.  Running this script will first show the results of the behaviour tests and then the unit tests.  When you're done, you can shut down the venv with `deactivate`.

To run the display, first make sure Docker is installed, then run these commands.

```bash
docker build -t zmq_proxy:latest .
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 zmq_proxy:latest
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in a browser.  With this, you'll see a webpage which every second writes some JSON in a bullet list, where each bullet ought to looks something like this (though it won't be printed as nicely).
